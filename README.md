# Solutions to Matt Parker's Maths Puzzles in Rust

These are my solutions to [Matt Parker's Maths Puzzles][maths-puzzles]
written in the [Rust programming language][rust-lang].

The solutions are wrapped up in a single executable.
The puzzle can be selected with a command-line argument.
Run the program with `--help` to see the puzzle names.
Run the program with `--help` after the puzzle name
to see additional parameters for solving a variant of the puzzle.

To build the program, you need Cargo,
which should come with the Rust compiler.
You can also run the program easily with Cargo:

```
cargo run -- --help
cargo run -- <puzzle-name>
cargo run -- <puzzle-name> --help
```

Unit tests can be executed with:

```
cargo test
```
